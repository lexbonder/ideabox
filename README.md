# ideabox
IdeaBox is the second paired project in Mod 1 front end at Turing. 


### Refactoring
This project has been forked from the original repo for refactoring purposes. I will refactor functions so that they are single purpose and card objects are decoupled from markup more thoroughly. I will also implement other changes suggested during our team review.

### Draft one of project:
The original project I worked with Alex Bonder. [Original Specs](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/ideabox.html). This repo is for refactoring and adding extra things for my own learning.
IdeaBox is an application that allows a user to enter an idea and a title and post it to the page. Ideas can be given a quality, marked as completed, searched by content, and edited. All changes to cards are persisted in local storage. It is written using jQuery and JSON for local storage.
